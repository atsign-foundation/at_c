# atclient_esp32_static_no_components

This example achieves the same outcome as [atclient_esp32_static_components](../atclient_esp32_static_components/README.md) but without the use of components. This is following the same example that ESP-IDf [provides](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/build_system/cmake/import_prebuilt), but I find components to be more elegant.
